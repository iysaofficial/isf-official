                <p>In an era of globalisation marked by the rapid development of science and technology, the ability to think critically, analytically and creatively has become a very important skill. The complexity of the modern world requires the younger generation to be able to understand, analyse and create solutions to various global challenges. Science Competition serves as a platform designed to hone these skills, while introducing participants to the dynamics of the ever-evolving world of science. Through this competition, the younger generation is not only trained to be more competent in academics, but also to think holistically and innovatively in solving real world problems.</p>
                <p>The development of global challenges, such as climate change, energy security, and technological advancements, requires science-based approaches that are not only innovative but also implementable. The competition aims to galvanise the younger generation's interest in science and technology, while encouraging them to explore their potential in finding creative solutions. In addition, the competition is an ideal medium to instill structured problem-solving skills, build confidence, and broaden global horizons through cross-cultural collaboration.</p>
                <p>More than just a competition, Science Competition is a catalyst in improving the quality of science education in various countries. By providing an inspiring and competitive environment, the competition is expected to produce a generation of scientists who not only master the theory, but also have the passion to contribute to the advancement of human civilisation. Participation in this competition also opens opportunities for participants to build international networks, share knowledge, and learn from experts in various fields.
